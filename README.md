# algorithms  

In this repository I go over the knapsack problem and provide a powerpoint presentation outlining my thought process. I use the python programming language and the method for dynamic programming as outlined in the 9th chapter of the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. A link to that chapter can be found [here](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-9/).  

All of this code is original to myself but I am aware that since this problem was solved in this particular way there are codes very similar to mine like [this example from geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-dynamic-programming-set-10-0-1-knapsack-problem/) and [this example by Tim Downey](https://dev.to/downey/solving-the-knapsack-problem-with-dynamic-programming-4hce).
